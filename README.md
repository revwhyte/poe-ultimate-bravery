# Path of Exile: Ultimate Bravery
I'm writing a bot to pick an insane Path of Exile build. It's fun to troll your beginner friends, so you'll have time to teach them the game properly while they're playing.

This idea was based on the [Ultimate Bravery](https://ultimate-bravery.net/) for League of Legends game, made by some player from the Community.

The idea is pretty simple: you run the code and it gives you character, ascension and ability.

Then you must build your char around it. No crying. Just take it.

## Version 1.0
* You can roll char, ascension and main skill.

## TO-DO
* Create groups of skills (main skills, movement skills, defense skills, pet skills) and roll one of each.
* After that, create a list of supports (must check compatibility with the skills) for each skill picked that way.

## Running

First, you may have Python 3+ installed in your machine, in order to run this.

Then, open your terminal in this project folder, and type:
```shell
python pickABuild.py
```

The magic will happen at your terminal.

Accept your fate. Hear the call. Save Oriath, Exile.
